    # Adds commands to the input queue, so they will be later retrieved by
    # Processor, i.e., it emulates user's input.
    #
    # If a command is a Proc object, it will be executed before being retrieved
    # by Processor. May be handy when you need build a command depending on the
    # current context.
    #
    # @example
    #
    #   enter "b 12", "cont"
    #   enter "b 12", ->{ "disable #{breakpoint.id}" }, "cont"
    #

    #
    # The string is copied to a new file and then that file is run. This is
    # done, instead of using `instance_eval` or similar techniques, because
    # it's useful to load a real file in order to make assertions on backtraces
    # or file names.
    #
    # @param program String containing Ruby code to be run. This string could
    # be any valid Ruby code, but in order to avoid redefinition warnings in
    # the test suite, it should define at most one class inside the DEBUGGER__
    # namespace. The name of this class is defined by the +example_class+
    # method.
    #
    # @param &block Optional proc which will be executed when Processor
    # extracts all the commands from the input queue. You can use that for
    # making assertions on the current test. If you specified the block and it
    # was never executed, the test will fail.
    #
    # @example
    #
    #   enter "next"
    #   prog <<-RUBY
    #     puts "hello"
    #   RUBY
    #
    #   debug_code(prog) { assert_equal 3, frame.line }
